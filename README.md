# Bring the 90s back!

This is a Gatsby site for the Silly Site challenge.  I wanted to re-created one of those old style websites that is full of gifs and has some things that used to be popular back then.

- Welcome on index page
- Links page
- Homepage with just some information about the owner of the site
- Gifs
- Guestbook
- More gifs
- That always present "under construction" gif

## Tech Stack

- Gatsby
- Airtable
- React hook form
- tables! Yeah I used tables just like the old times



## Gifs

Like any great 90s website, I needed a lot of cool gifs to include on the page. Here's where they where taken from.
